# figma-o-ailwind
This project is a frontend implementation of a webpage designed in Figma, using TailwindCSS for styling. The main goal is to transform the design mockup into a fully functional, responsive HTML webpage, preserving the accuracy of spacing, colors, typography, and images from the original design.
